A vim plugin to edit Evernote notes

#Current State
This is currently in very early stages of develoment; it is still using the Evernote sandbox until there is a stable version that can read from Evernote.

In the [TODO.md](evernote.vim/blob/master/TODO.md) file there is a semi-up to date list of things that need done.
