A vim plugin to edit Evernote notes

#Current State
This is currently in very early stages of develoment; it is still using the official [Evernote sandbox](http://sandbox.evernote.com/) until there is a stable version that can read from Evernote.

In the [TODO.md](evernote.vim/blob/master/TODO.md) file there is a semi-up to date list of things that need done.

#Requirements
* vim with ruby baked-in
* the [evernote gem](http://rubygems.org/gems/evernote)
